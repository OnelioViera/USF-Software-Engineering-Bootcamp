                        <h3>Welcome to your first assignment!</h3>

                        <p>Learning a new skill can be hard, so setting yourself up for success by preparing is essential. Once your cohort begins, you’ll receive access to the Software Engineering curriculum. Before then, please work through this prework to ensure that you have all the necessary skills and tools you’ll need to complete the course.</p>

                        <p>The following sections of this prework cover important programming languages that will come up throughout your Software Engineering course. These include programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are independent languages, but they work together to build websites these days; every single website you have interacted with has been constructed by using the three.</p>

                        <p>This prework is designed to help you become comfortable with these languages so that you can keep pace while working through the course and get the most of the curriculum. It also has introductory resources on several tools you will be using over the course of your career in software. The entire pre-work assignment will take you roughly 7 hours to complete, so please work through it in the days leading up to the start of your course.</p>

                        <p>Before you jump right into it, please note that if you struggle with any topic, do not get disheartened or demotivated to proceed with the career path you have chosen. Coding might seem a little intimidating when you're a new learner, and it is perfectly natural to take some time to get used to it. You can always make a note of your doubts and discuss them with the mentor during your regular calls once the cohort begins. The Springboard support system is made available especially for situations like these and will be more than willing to help you out whenever you need it.</p>

                        <p>We are confident that this will be a nice and engaging experience for you, and our job is to ensure that you find success in the program. Happy learning!</p>
